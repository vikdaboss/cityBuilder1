using this small godot project as a way to learn how to create editor tools in GDScript.
The goal is to make a top-down line editor, in the style of DOOM's level editor, that will generate floor plans for buildings. (currently in progress)
A layer of procedural destructions will then be added to these buildings (TODO)
